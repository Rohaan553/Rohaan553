ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Rohaan Wasim, and I'm currently learning Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I am keen on exploring the numerous different fields in CS
and finding the one that suits me best! I enjoy programming in Java and Python, and I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript to explore the 
web development world. Thanks for reading!
