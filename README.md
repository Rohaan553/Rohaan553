ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Rohaan, and I'm currently a sophomore learning Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I am keen on exploring the numerous different fields in CS
and finding the one that suits me best! I enjoy programming in Java and Python, and I am in love with web development using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript. I plan on exploring Data Science, Machine & Deep Learning, and Cyber Security in the coming years. Thanks for reading!
